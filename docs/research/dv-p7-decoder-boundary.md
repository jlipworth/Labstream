# Dolby Vision P7 decoder boundary

Investigation for [issue #316](https://github.com/jlipworth/Labstream/issues/316).
No shipping metadata transformation or expanded device-support claim is established.
The [native HDR investigation](native-hdr-validation.md) owns general HDR evidence;
this note isolates the P7 format-description and compressed-sample gates.

## Control provenance

The passing native HDR10 control is a **different library file**, not an extracted
base layer from the failing P7 file. It disproves a blanket HDR decode failure on
that host but cannot establish safe normalization of the P7 source. The existing
same-source control is an explicitly approved capped encode: inspected decoded
frames and BT.709 attachments establish SDR output, not preserved DV or HDR10.

The failing source is HEVC Main10 in MKV with P7/HDR10-compatible base-layer facts.
Plex reports video copy and audio transcode. Its captured fMP4 initialization contains
`hvc1`, `hvcC`, `dvcC` P7 and PQ/BT.2020 color signaling. Native AVPlayer fails with
AVFoundation -11855 wrapping VideoToolbox -12910, with decoder-selection -12906.
HDR-on master and HDR-off bounded single-child attempts both failed.

## Exact-initialization experiment

On the same native macOS 27 beta host, the read-only
`scripts/dv-decoder-init-probe.swift` loads the captured local initialization file
through AVFoundation and calls `VTDecompressionSessionCreate`. It submits **no samples**.

| Format-description case | P7 HDR-on capture | P7 HDR-off capture | Separate HDR10 control |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Original AVFoundation description | -12910 | -12910 | 0 |
| Reconstructed with all original extensions | -12910 | -12910 | 0 |
| Only DV atom entries omitted from extension-atom dictionary | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Original extensions restored | -12910 | -12910 | 0 |

Both P7 descriptions contain `hvcC` and `dvcC`; the contrast removes only `dvcC`.
The configuration reports profile 7, level 6, compatibility ID 6 and BL/EL/RPU flags;
those flags describe signaling, not an inventory of compressed samples.
Subtype, dimensions and all other extensions, including color information, remain
unchanged. Round-trip and restoration controls reproduce rejection. This isolates
an admission gate in the delivered DV format description on this host. A successful
session constructor does **not** prove sample acceptance, accurate output, enhancement
layer reconstruction, AVPlayer HLS playback, seeking or physical HDR presentation.

Reproduce with private captured evidence, never a credential-bearing network URL:

```sh
mkdir -p build/dv316
swiftc -parse-as-library scripts/dv-decoder-init-probe.swift -o build/dv316/dv-init-probe
build/dv316/dv-init-probe --self-test
build/dv316/dv-init-probe /path/to/private/init.mp4
```

The deterministic self-test verifies that only DV atom dictionary entries change,
input dictionaries stay unchanged, and unrelated extensions survive. Decoder status
is a host-specific experimental result, not a portable CI assertion. The tool does
not rewrite its input, use app credentials or make a production playback change.

## Profiles and signaling are not interchangeable

- **P5** has no ordinary HDR10-compatible base layer. Keep the existing P5 safety
  guard and explicit encoding consent; this P7 experiment is not a P5 workaround.
- **P7** uses base and enhancement layers. HDR10 compatibility of the base does not
  imply that a player accepts a P7-signaled container. MEL and FEL are not equivalent:
  FEL carries nonzero residual information, while MEL does not require residual
  reconstruction. Delivering only the base is not full P7 reproduction.
- **P8.1** is HDR10-compatible; **P8.4** is HLG-compatible. Do not interpret every P8
  stream as HDR10, or relabel P7 as P8 without validating its metadata and samples.

Dolby's [UHD Blu-ray workflow, section 5](https://professional.dolby.com/siteassets/pdfs/dolby_vision_uhd_bluray_authoring_workflow.pdf)
describes the P7 base/enhancement distinction. Apple's
[HLS authoring rules](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http-live-streaming/hls-authoring-specification-for-apple-devices)
and [codec-signaling appendix](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http-live-streaming/hls-authoring-specification-for-apple-devices-appendixes)
describe delivery requirements and P8.1/P8.4 supplemental signaling; they do not
establish that this Plex P7 remux works on every Apple device. The
[dovi_tool implementation documentation](https://github.com/quietvoid/dovi_tool#conversion-modes)
distinguishes P8.1 RPU conversion (including removal of FEL mapping) from enhancement
layer removal. Merely changing a profile number or deleting a configuration box is
not that conversion. No new conversion dependency is introduced here.

## Sample acquisition status

A fresh, isolated native app paired through normal Plex authentication, selected the
correct video server, verified the exact source binding and reproduced copy failure
with encoding consent required. The new initialization capture reproduced the same
four-way decoder-construction result. No credentials or existing app sessions were
copied.

A temporary, opt-in first-segment collector retained no compressed sample file on its
initial attempt. Its instrumented bounded retry could not be verified after the host
locked and computer-use access required manual unlock. The collector is not a shipping
change. No sample-decoding, base-layer frame-equivalence or normalized-HLS success is
claimed from these attempts. Continuing requires an unlocked native app and a complete,
provenance-bound minimal sample capture; it does not require production access.

## Safe-delivery acceptance gates

Before a runtime normalization candidate can be justified:

1. Acquire a bounded init and compressed sample sequence from the **same source and
   same copy session**, using normal app authentication. Bind the exact source and
   selected child in private provenance. A diagnostic child fetched independently
   is not automatically the variant that AVPlayer decoded.
2. Compare original samples with an explicitly identified HDR10 base-layer derivative.
   Preserve base VCL samples, timing, parameter sets, PQ/BT.2020 and applicable static
   HDR metadata. Inventory RPU and enhancement-layer NAL units; an initialization
   `el_present` flag alone does not establish actual sample contents or MEL/FEL type.
3. Separately test configuration-only admission, compressed-sample decoding and
   inspected frame equivalence. Retained EL/RPU data, mismatched container signaling,
   incomplete fragments and unknown source facts must not silently become “HDR10.”
4. Validate any proposed HLS remux end to end, including initial frames, seek, reopen,
   range requests and discontinuities. Require deterministic malformed-input and
   P5/P7/P8 regression coverage. Keep Generic and copy/encode consent unchanged.
5. Record physical device/display gates independently. A native decoder session or
   simulator frame cannot establish DV processing, HDR luminance or support elsewhere.

## Fallback proposal

Until those gates pass, retain the existing behavior: attempt eligible copy playback;
if it fails, stop that attempt and ask before starting a video encoder. Explain that
Original could not decode on the current path and that an approved compatibility
encode may lower resolution and produce SDR. Declining must not launch an encoder.
Do not globally block all P7, change server configuration, rewrite library files,
weaken the P5 guard or treat speculative metadata stripping as a repair.
